## 10. Problem Solving

### Story 1: DPV Code Coverage for C++ Designs (Synopsys)

**Situation**: "Semiconductor clients at Synopsys were struggling to verify complex datapath designs implemented in C++, with no effective way to measure verification completeness or identify over-constrained scenarios that might hide bugs."

**Task**: "I needed to develop a code coverage and constraint analysis solution for C++ designs that would work within the formal verification framework, despite formal verification traditionally not supporting this type of analysis."

**Action**: "I first broke down the problem into distinct components: static analysis of the C++ code structure, runtime tracking of verification paths, and constraint analysis for identifying potential blind spots. I discovered that existing approaches from software testing couldn't be directly applied due to the massive state spaces involved in hardware verification. I developed a novel hybrid approach that combined symbolic execution techniques with formal property checking. When initial prototypes showed performance issues with large designs, I implemented a hierarchical analysis approach that could efficiently process complex designs by analyzing subcomponents independently."

**Result**: "The solution successfully identified verification gaps in customers' designs that were previously invisible, with one customer discovering a critical bug that would have cost millions in chip redesign. The hierarchical approach enabled the tool to handle designs 10x larger than initially targeted, making it applicable to the most complex customer projects. The technology was later patented and became a key differentiator for our formal verification products."

**Reflection**: "This experience reinforced the importance of decomposing complex problems into manageable components while maintaining a holistic view of how they fit together. The most valuable solutions often come from combining techniques from different domains in novel ways."

### Story 2: Web Editor Performance for Large Documents (Adobe)

**Situation**: "Adobe's AEM Web Editor was becoming unusable with large documents, with loading times exceeding 30 seconds and frequent freezing during editing operations."

**Task**: "I needed to diagnose and resolve the performance issues while maintaining full functionality and ensuring backward compatibility with existing documents."

**Action**: "I approached this methodically, first implementing comprehensive performance monitoring to identify bottlenecks. This revealed that DOM manipulation and layout recalculation were the primary issues, but simple optimizations only yielded modest improvements. I reframed the problem from 'how to make the editor faster' to 'how to edit large documents efficiently,' which led me to investigate virtualization techniques. I developed a custom document model that maintained logical structure while only rendering visible portions in the DOM. This required solving complex challenges around cursor positioning, selection, and maintaining editing context across virtualized content."

**Result**: "The implementation reduced loading times by 60% for large documents and eliminated freezing issues. Memory usage decreased by 70%, and the editor could now handle documents 5x larger than previously possible. The performance improvements directly saved several major enterprise client relationships that had been at risk due to the issues."

**Reflection**: "This project demonstrated that effective problem solving often requires stepping back to reconsider the fundamental approach rather than optimizing an existing solution. By reframing the problem and being willing to implement a more ambitious architectural change, we achieved breakthrough improvements that wouldn't have been possible through incremental optimizations."

### Story 3: PowerPoint Recording Studio Video Quality (Microsoft)

**Situation**: "The PowerPoint Recording Studio feature needed to implement background blur capabilities, but early prototypes suffered from poor video quality, high CPU usage, and frame dropping on typical customer hardware."

**Task**: "I needed to find a way to deliver high-quality video effects without requiring powerful hardware or compromising on the user experience."

**Action**: "I systematically analyzed the performance characteristics of different video processing approaches, identifying that traditional CPU-based blur algorithms were the primary bottleneck. Rather than simply reducing quality, I explored alternatives including WebGL-based processing, optimized algorithms, and hybrid approaches. I created a benchmarking framework to objectively compare different approaches across various hardware profiles representing our user base. After identifying a promising direction using hardware acceleration, I implemented a fallback mechanism that could adaptively adjust quality based on the user's hardware capabilities."

**Result**: "The solution delivered high-quality background blur that worked smoothly across 95% of our target hardware profiles, including mid-range laptops. The adaptive approach ensured that all users got the best experience their hardware could support, with automatic quality adjustments that maintained consistent frame rates. This feature was a key contributor to growing monthly active users from 1.5M to 4.2M."

**Reflection**: "This experience highlighted the importance of deeply understanding the constraints and considering adaptive solutions that can work across diverse environments. By focusing on the core user need (smooth, professional-looking video) rather than a specific implementation, we found a flexible solution that worked for our broad user base."
