### STARR Breakdown

**Situation**: "At Synopsys, our semiconductor clients like Nvidia and Intel were facing increasing challenges in verifying complex datapath designs, with potential missed bugs leading to costly chip redesigns. Formal verification tools traditionally provided limited visibility into which portions of C++ designs were effectively verified, leaving potential gaps in coverage."

**Task**: "As Staff Engineer, I was tasked with designing and implementing code coverage and over-constraint analysis for formal verification that could handle the complexity and scale of modern semiconductor designs while providing actionable insights about verification completeness."

**Action**: "I led this initiative by first developing a deep understanding of customer verification workflows through site visits and engineering discussions. I then created a approach that combined static analysis of C++ designs with dynamic tracking of formal verification paths. This required solving several technical challenges:

1. Efficiently representing coverage data for massive state spaces
2. Developing heuristics to identify meaningful coverage metrics specific to formal verification
3. Leveraged symbolic execution engine that could analyze which branches and conditions were exhaustively verified versus those that relied on constraints

When performance issues emerged with large designs, I implemented a hierarchical analysis approach that could efficiently process complex designs by analyzing subcomponents independently. I also personally mentored two junior engineers who joined the project, helping them understand the complex domain while accelerating our development timeline."

**Result**: "The implementation provided unprecedented visibility into verification coverage, enabling customers to identify gaps in their verification approach. For critical designs at a major client, coverage improved from an estimated 85% to a measured 97% after addressing the gaps identified by our tool. One customer discovered a critical bug that would have cost millions in chip redesign. The novel coverage metrics we developed have been presented at industry conferences and are being considered for standardization. Additionally, the technology was patented and became a key differentiator for our formal verification products."

**Reflection**: "This project taught me the value of deeply understanding customer problems before proposing technical solutions. By spending time with verification engineers to understand their workflows and pain points, we created a solution that addressed real needs rather than just adding technical capabilities. The experience also reinforced the importance of balancing theoretical correctness with practical usability - we had to make careful tradeoffs to ensure the tool provided actionable insights without overwhelming users with excessive detail."

## PowerPoint Recording Studio Enhancements (Microsoft)

### Alternative Favorite Project

**Situation**: "Microsoft's PowerPoint Recording Studio had potential to transform how users created presentation content, but was underutilized due to limited capabilities and performance issues. Users wanted more professional-looking recording options including background blur and customizable Cameo for seamless slide-video integration."

**Task**: "I led the effort to enhance Recording Studio with these capabilities, overcoming significant technical hurdles in the video processing pipeline while ensuring performance on standard hardware."

**Action**: "I approached this challenge by first building expertise in video processing technologies through intensive self-study and collaboration with experts across Microsoft. I architected an enhanced video pipeline that could support effects like background blur while maintaining performance. When initial implementations faced quality and performance issues, I persisted through multiple iterations, eventually discovering a novel approach using hardware acceleration combined with optimized algorithms.

I personally implemented the most challenging aspects of the Cameo feature, which required precise synchronization between presenter video and slide content. Throughout development, I maintained focus on end-user experience, regularly testing with real users to refine the interface and features."

**Result**: "The enhanced Recording Studio dramatically increased user adoption, growing monthly active users from 1.5 million to 4.2 million, with 1.2 million users specifically utilizing the Cameo feature. The background blur capability delivered professional-looking recordings on standard hardware, transforming how enterprise users created presentation content. These enhancements represented one of the most successful feature adoption increases in PowerPoint's recent history."

**Reflection**: "This project taught me the importance of perseverance when implementing breakthrough features. By maintaining focus on user value rather than technical constraints, we pushed through multiple implementation challenges to deliver capabilities that significantly improved the product. The experience reinforced that technical challenges often require both creative problem-solving and willingness to restart when initial approaches don't yield the desired results."
