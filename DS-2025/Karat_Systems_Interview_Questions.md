## Q1: Photo Storage Sharding
**Tags:** `sharding` `data-distribution` `photo-storage` `scalability`

**Question:** 
We are running a simple photo storage and sharing service. People upload their photos to our servers and then give links to other users who can then view them.

We're trying to figure out how to split the photos and associated data evenly onto multiple machines, especially as we get new users. We've decided to shard the photos evenly alphabetically by username. For example, if we had 26 servers, all the usernames starting with 'a' would be on server 1, usernames starting with 'b' would be on server 2, and so on. We have created a scheme like this that will work for any number of servers.

Are there any problems with this design?

**Answer:**
**Main Issue:** Alphabetical sharding creates uneven load distribution and fundamental scaling problems.

**Critical Problems:**

**Load Distribution Issues:**
- **Uneven User Distribution:** Names starting with common letters (A, B, C, J, M, S) significantly outnumber rare letters (Q, X, Z)
- **Hot Spots:** Servers handling popular letters become overloaded while others remain underutilized
- **Geographic Bias:** Different cultures have varying name distribution patterns, creating regional imbalances
- **Temporal Variations:** User activity patterns differ by letter groups, causing time-based load spikes

**Scalability Challenges:**
- **Resharding Nightmare:** Adding new servers requires complete data migration and redistribution
- **No Graceful Growth:** Cannot easily accommodate organic user growth without major infrastructure changes
- **Maintenance Complexity:** Rebalancing requires coordinating across multiple servers simultaneously
- **Downtime Risk:** Data migration periods create service availability issues

**Performance & Reliability:**
- **Query Hotspots:** Popular username prefixes create database query bottlenecks
- **Storage Imbalance:** Some servers run out of space while others have excess capacity
- **Network Congestion:** High-traffic servers experience bandwidth saturation
- **Backup Complexity:** Uneven data distribution complicates backup and recovery strategies

**Better Solutions:**

**Hash-Based Sharding:**
- **Consistent Hashing:** Use hash(user_id) % server_count for uniform distribution
- **Virtual Nodes:** Implement multiple virtual nodes per physical server for better load balancing
- **Deterministic Routing:** Ensure same user always routes to same server for consistency

**Advanced Approaches:**
- **Range-Based Sharding:** Partition by user_id ranges with dynamic rebalancing
- **Directory-Based:** Use lookup service to map users to servers with real-time optimization
- **Hybrid Strategy:** Combine multiple sharding techniques based on access patterns

**Implementation Best Practices:**
- **Monitor Load Metrics:** Track CPU, memory, storage, and network usage per server
- **Auto-scaling:** Implement automatic server provisioning based on load thresholds
- **Data Replication:** Maintain multiple copies for high availability and disaster recovery
- **Gradual Migration:** Use blue-green deployment for seamless data redistribution

**Key Success Factor:** Choose sharding strategy that distributes both data and load evenly while supporting seamless horizontal scaling.
