# LeetCode Interview Preparation Guide
Each category contains detailed problem descriptions, optimal approaches, time and space complexity analysis, and efficient C++ solutions.

## Categories

1. **Arrays and Strings**
   - Fundamental data structures that appear in ~40% of interview questions
   - Key techniques: Hash tables, two pointers, sliding window

2. **Binary Trees**
   - Essential tree traversal and manipulation techniques
   - Common patterns: DFS, BFS, recursive vs. iterative approaches

3. **Linked Lists**
   - Pointer manipulation and list operations
   - Key techniques: Fast/slow pointers, dummy nodes, in-place modifications

4. **Graphs**
   - Graph traversal and search algorithms
   - Key algorithms: BFS, DFS, Union-Find, topological sort

5. **Stack-Based**
   - Problems that use stack data structure for elegant solutions
   - Common applications: Parentheses matching, expression evaluation, monotonic stacks

6. **Sliding Window / Two Pointer**
   - Techniques for array/string processing with O(n) time complexity
   - Fixed-size vs. variable-size windows, inside-out vs. outside-in approaches

7. **Data Structure and Design**
   - Implementation of complex data structures and systems
   - Focus on efficient operations and space management

8. **Binary Search**
   - Divide-and-conquer approach for search problems
   - Various templates for different search requirements

## Study Strategy for 40-Minute Interviews

1. **First 5 minutes**: 
   - Understand the problem thoroughly
   - Ask clarifying questions
   - Define input/output format and constraints
   - Identify edge cases

2. **Next 5-10 minutes**:
   - Discuss brute force approach briefly
   - Develop optimal approach
   - Analyze time and space complexity

3. **Next 15-20 minutes**:
   - Implement the solution with clean, readable code
   - Use meaningful variable names
   - Handle edge cases explicitly

4. **Last 5-10 minutes**:
   - Test your solution with examples
   - Debug if necessary
   - Discuss potential optimizations or extensions

## Time Management Tips

1. **Identify the problem type quickly**
   - Look for key phrases that hint at the approach
   - Match with common patterns you've studied

2. **Start with high-level approach**
   - Outline your algorithm in pseudocode before coding
   - Get interviewer buy-in on your approach

3. **Use comments strategically**
   - Document your thought process
   - Create function headers before implementation

4. **Write clean code from the start**
   - Avoid rushing and creating bugs
   - Use standard patterns for common operations

5. **Test methodically**
   - Start with simple examples
   - Then test edge cases
   - Walk through the code execution step by step
