Find the missing number
We are given an array containing ‘n’ distinct numbers taken from the range 0 to ‘n’. Since the array has only ‘n’ numbers out of the total ‘n+1’ numbers, find the missing number. See the example below.

    int missingNumber(vector<int>& arr) {
        long sum = 0;
        for(auto x: arr){
            sum += x;
        }
        long n = arr.size();
        
        return n*(n+1)/2 - sum;
    }
